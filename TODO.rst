- dummy context manager
- dummy file

cacheutils
----------

- counting dictionary (with sys.modules example)

dictutils
---------

- autoindexing list for dictionaries. As records get added, uses a
  basic proportion-based heuristic to create subdictionaries as
  indexes over the same data. Maybe automatically does a full-scan
  option too.
- non-overwriting version of dict.update()

jsonutils
---------

* jsonl ignore blank lines
* jsonl add line number to error message

misc?
-----

- wrap_trace debug utility. Takes an object, looks at its dir, wraps
  everything callable, with a hook. Needs an enable/disable flag.
  - get/set/call/return/exception
  - __slots__

- Tracking proxy. An object that always succeeds for all operations, saving the call history.
- Top/Bottom singletons (greater than and less than everything)


cliutils
--------

- progress bar
- confirmation prompt (e.g., "Question? (Y/n)")

tbutils
-------

- fold repeated frames (recursive calls)

statsutils
----------

- dirty bit auto clears cache on property access
- geometric mean (2 ** sum(log(a, b, ...))

funcutils
---------
